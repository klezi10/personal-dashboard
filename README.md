## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- If Chrome extension uploaded, clicking "new tab" has been overridden to see the dashboard
- Be able to read the current time based on location (updated every second), weather based on geolocation, random nature background photo & author, specific crypto, currency, and stock prices.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- API Integration
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was good practice in working with different APIs and to pull in the time based on location in a few lines of code. I also learned the types of free and available financial APIs. I also learned how to check for error responses.

### Continued development

I have repeated code and would like to learn how to improve by code by applying DRY.

### Useful resources

- I used a few APIs for the personal dashboard. For the background photo, I used unsplash API. For the currency, I used freecurrencyapi.net. For the cryptocurrency, I used coingecko.com. For the stock prices, I used alphavantage.co. For the weather, I used openweathermap.org. I used Scrimba's "Promise, Rejection & Capstone" course under "Working with APIs" for the initial layout and project idea, then improved it by adding additional APIs and information based on my own interests.
